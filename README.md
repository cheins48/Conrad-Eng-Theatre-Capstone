# Conrad-Eng-Theatre-Capstone

## Project pitch



[Project Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iXmvU82mosjtG8wZw2aXcDX5GKvR7SZYwwKy2Fu6weY/edit#slide=id.gee834ea57d_0_261)

As of right now, the theatre program is planning a production of little shop of horrors at the end of the year. This is a very technically heavy performance with a dynamic set, interesting characters and, most importantly, a giant man eating alien plant.  My capstone project this year will be to make all of the plant puppets necessary to bring this production to life.

### Requirements 

-Have 4 separate pods

    -1st pod must have a “wilting” feature to show its dying and be hand held.

    -2nd must be slightly larger, and have more vibrant colors to indicate it growing

    -3rd must be a full wearable costume that can be worn by an actor

    -4th will be made to have the ability to “eat ” someone whole and be built in tandem with the set

-Have interactable props by may 10th

### Wants


-Integrate “bioluminescence” with code

-Traumatize at LEAST one small child

I will be doing my best to divide my build schedule quarterly to get all four pods done.  I will also be delegateing a lot of work to Pd.3 Tech to account for the massive workload and my lack of a partner.  I will also be building the puppets in order of priority

1.  Pod.1, because I can finish it the fastest without consulting set design or pd.3 tech

2.  Pod.4, because its the most technical design

3.  Pod.3, because I want pod.4 done first

4.  Pod.2, because it can be entirley cut out of the play

### Build Updates

I have made cardboard linkages to prototype, they work great but still have a few problems.  theyre all a little more than 100mm wide when resting which i need to trim down if theyre gonna fit in a PVC pipe.  I'm also not happy with the arch, I want a more natural lean forward that Kreutinger's design has.

I have fully modeled the "pot" that holds the linkages and houses the plant. the pot is modeled after 4in PVC that mr miller generously donated.  I had to fiddle with the lengths of each of the linkages to allow it to fit inside of the pot. i cut out some of the smaleer ones out of acrylic, it was noticibly harder to actuate than the cardboard, and the top two linkages were measured wrong so ive had to go back and redesign them so they sit flat.  I also made a failed prototype for the head that im not even gonna discuss because of how little sense it made.

the pot consists of 2 rings that rest on the interior, the bottom one will be screwed in place while the top one will be free spinning to allow for articulation and more poseability for the actor. they should both be finished priniting by the end of this period.

 this week I printed out the two rings and put them inside the 4in pipe.  right now the achor ring is held in with temporary 4:40 screws, but will be replaced with heated inserts.  the turning is smooth and im happy with the articulation with the linkages.  the biggest issue right now is actually fitting my hand into the pot and grabbing the bottom linkages, currently i have two offcut linkages just sorta dangaling in there, but i need a more ergonomic solution for an actor.  current solution seams to be a string with a loop on the end, but more experimenting is required.

    10/21/2022
   This week i forgot to press commit after i made my whole post,  so im writing it again 13 days later.  i made a prototype for the top jaw by heating and twisting 2 acrylic pieces, theyre held together with a rubberband.  the rubberbands tension is way to high, so im going to replace it with a spring or something else, and because the 2 jaw pieces were put on seperate sides of the linkage they are horribly misaligned.  I belived at the time of writing this that the solution to this was 3D printing the top and bottom jaw, but i instead laser cut them and superglued a piece of acrilic perpendicular to the base jaws.  all the nuts have been replaced with lock-nuts, and washers have been put between each linkage.  This has done wonders for the posablity of it.

    11/3/2022
   this week I got the top jaw working.  I solved my previous issue of the bottom linkages by attaching them at the very ends of either one, creating a sort of V that I can easily grab the bottom of.  the top jaw was initially designed with the intention of having a spring or rubber band on the inside pulling it shut, however it proved to be difficult to open with the string, and the spring would often open the mouth because it was to long.  having a loose connection and just allowing the top jaw to close using the force of gravity proved to work perfectly fine.  the linkage for the top jaw kept intersecting with the nuts on the supporting linkages, preventing it from closing all the way, so I opted to use a rat tail file and just sanded out a groove for the nuts to rest rather than redesign, recut, and reglue the whole piece again.

    11/9/2022
   with the Pod.1 design having most all functional aspects taken care of, the time has come to pass my work onto pd.3 tech for them to work on detail work.  The design process for pod.4 has begun and im shifting my full focus to actuallising it.  after lots of research I have decided to base my design off of [feathurwurms](https://www.instructables.com/Building-Audrey-II-Phase-IV/) genius puppet.  I will be attaching the notes and images I found most useful from featherwurms instructable.

the design is very human.  the frame is simply 2 pipes attached to a simple ramp at the bottom and a trapazoid with 2 eyelits at the top.  the top jaw is suspended by 2 strings attached to the eyelits on either side of the base frame to create a pivot point that the actor can easily move and manipulate.  suspending the bottom jaw is my current hangup.  making it stationary removes a lot of expression from the plant, as well as making it pottentially harder for an actor to get eaten.  but feathurwurms design apears to be using pure wizardry to hold it up.  my current solution (as seen in research image 4) is to replicate the top jaw fulcrum on the interior side of the top jaw.  my concern with this design is weight, and having potentiontial tangles with the rope.  mo rope, mo problems.  I have begun designing the ramp in CAD, but I plan on potentially using a kiddie slide instead, 1. because i can probably find one for free, and 2. because its fun. so i will not be posting my proggress on the CAD until I'm sure I will be using it.

  Ive decided to start with a 1:12 miniature proof of concept to get my scale and proportions right before making the full scale model. This week I made the frame and top jaw, next i will make the bottom jaw and work out any kinks.  the top jaw is very front heavy, maybe add nuts as counterweight?  The base frame  currently stands at 6-7 inches tall, this may be an inch or two to big. this could cause problems for the bottom jaw opening enough to allow an actor to get eaten, however i have no way of knowing if this an actual issue until i attach the bottom jaw. the proportions look nearly perfect, and the top jaw has no issues with collidening with the top of the frame and at full scale, a 7 foot tall plant is bound to look intimidateing.

   I'm a little behind schedule, i was hoping to have begun on the full sized frame by december 1st, but due to illness I havent been able to come to school.  this week Ive made the proof of concept to a point that im happy with.  the lower jaw went through a few different designs, all of which were either to big or the laser cutter flat out refused to cut. but copying the frame of the top jaw with an egg like shape on the bottom ended up being the best design.  the elastic bands attaching the bottom jaw to the top were slightly to short, but this served to my advantage. by giving that small amount of resistance to pulling down the lower jaw i somehow made a fulcrum that opens both the bottom and top jaw.  i have no idea ho it works, but i hope to replicate this in my full scale build.  next week i plan on making the full sized frame hanger with materials in theatre tech.

 this week I finished the frame hangar.  I used an old box that fit the measurements roughly and left over 2 inch PVC from my no home but roped and stakes set.  the 2 legs of PVC are attached to the box useing hanging wire and a long screw, the screws stuck out a bit into the slide so I used a angle grinder to grind off the sharp points.  the top PVC piece fell down and hit my head pretty hard, I didnt secure it down because i wanted the whole design to be collapsable, but I think I'm going to PVC cement the upper "U" of the hanger and have the whole unit just be 2 pieces to avoid more injury. however, I cant do this if I plan on widening the box, as I would also have to lengthen the top pipe.

  back from winter break and ready to work!  the search for metal to create the frame is becomming a massive problem, researching alternative materials (fiberglass??) may be my best course.  this week I plan on doing that, as well as widening the slide on the hangar frame. as it is, the box is a little more than a foot wide, just wide enough to go down with your arms over your head if you're a little guy.  if I widen the base ramp by .25-.5 of a foot it would accomedate for a cast member with a larger physique

  yesterday i widened the hangar frame and found a solution to my head material problem.  while researching other giant puppets I found [this dragon](https://cypt.ca/2019/08/05/a-blog-about-a-dragon-or-how-to-build-a-giant-dragon-puppet-in-858-easy-steps/) for shrek that used hula hoops for the body frame and simply wrapped it in fabric.  this would be a very easy material to use because its 
  1. very cheap 
  2. very big, 
  3. very lightweight
 this weekend I will make an attempt to go to the dollar store to see the available options, for now though I have made a model of the top jaw in onshape that uses hula hoops that are 40in, 30in,and 20in wide.

   little hard to make proggress this week with the end of the quarter as well as snow and the new york trip.  never the less I worked out a rough design of the lower jaw made of hula hoops (pictured below) as well using another hula hoop to create the hole for actors to crawls through. I also made a shopping list, on it is 3x 40 in, 30 in, and 20 in hula hoops, as well as about 15 hose clamps.

    2/9/2023

sorry for the lack of updates, the wait for materials has stunted my momentum with pod.4.  however I have been working diligently on pod.3 with the help of dylan hensley.  using dylans 3d model for rough measurements (pictured below),

i used garbage and willpower to make the top jaw of pod.3

sorry for blurry photos
 
 by the end of next week I will have the bottom jaw ready for paper mache and hopefully have the materials to begin work on pod.4

 made more proggress than i have in months yesterday!!!  I brought in about 100 zip ties and 20 hose clamps and framed out the entirity of the lower jaw useing the last of the "stems" we had donated during 3rd pd.  then i made a surprisingly effective hinge useing 3 zip ties attaching the top and bottom jaw together.

I took some design concepts I used in pod.4 on the lower jaw, specifically the "U" that rests on the actors waist while wearing the head.  this creats a fulcrum that allows for the lower jaw to open when the top jaw opens.  making the entire puppet to be able to be operated with just one hand.  next i spent pd.5 putting chicken wire over the lower jaw, I found that using the craft wire to sort of stitch the wire to the frame instead of twisting hundreds of wires together was faster and sturdier.  I wish the overall shape were a little rounder, but i  think i can fix that with apolstry foam.
