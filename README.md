# Conrad-Eng-Theatre-Capstone

## Project pitch



[Project Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iXmvU82mosjtG8wZw2aXcDX5GKvR7SZYwwKy2Fu6weY/edit#slide=id.gee834ea57d_0_261)

As of right now, the theatre program is planning a production of little shop of horrors at the end of the year. This is a very technically heavy performance with a dynamic set, interesting characters and, most importantly, a giant man eating alien plant.  My capstone project this year will be to make all of the plant puppets necessary to bring this production to life.

### Requirements 

-Have 4 separate pods

    -1st pod must have a “wilting” feature to show its dying and be hand held.

    -2nd must be slightly larger, and have more vibrant colors to indicate it growing

    -3rd must be a full wearable costume that can be worn by an actor

    -4th will be made to have the ability to “eat ” someone whole and be built in tandem with the set

-Have interactable props by may 10th

### Wants


-Integrate “bioluminescence” with code

-Traumatize at LEAST one small child

I will be doing my best to divide my build schedule quarterly to get all four pods done.  I will also be delegateing a lot of work to Pd.3 Tech to account for the massive workload and my lack of a partner.  I will also be building the puppets in order of priority

1.  Pod.1, because I can finish it the fastest without consulting set design or pd.3 tech

2.  Pod.4, because its the most technical design

3.  Pod.3, because I want pod.4 done first

4.  Pod.2, because it can be entirley cut out of the play

### Build Updates

I have made cardboard linkages to prototype, they work great but still have a few problems.  theyre all a little more than 100mm wide when resting which i need to trim down if theyre gonna fit in a PVC pipe.  I'm also not happy with the arch, I want a more natural lean forward that Kreutinger's design has.

I have fully modeled the "pot" that holds the linkages and houses the plant. the pot is modeled after 4in PVC that mr miller generously donated.  I had to fiddle with the lengths of each of the linkages to allow it to fit inside of the pot. i cut out some of the smaleer ones out of acrylic, it was noticibly harder to actuate than the cardboard, and the top two linkages were measured wrong so ive had to go back and redesign them so they sit flat.  I also made a failed prototype for the head that im not even gonna discuss because of how little sense it made.

the pot consists of 2 rings that rest on the interior, the bottom one will be screwed in place while the top one will be free spinning to allow for articulation and more poseability for the actor. they should both be finished priniting by the end of this period.

 this week I printed out the two rings and put them inside the 4in pipe.  right now the achor ring is held in with temporary 4:40 screws, but will be replaced with heated inserts.  the turning is smooth and im happy with the articulation with the linkages.  the biggest issue right now is actually fitting my hand into the pot and grabbing the bottom linkages, currently i have two offcut linkages just sorta dangaling in there, but i need a more ergonomic solution for an actor.  current solution seams to be a string with a loop on the end, but more experimenting is required.

   This week i forgot to press commit after i made my whole post,  so im writing it again 13 days later.  i made a prototype for the top jaw by heating and twisting 2 acrylic pieces, theyre held together with a rubberband.  the rubberbands tension is way to high, so im going to replace it with a spring or something else, and because the 2 jaw pieces were put on seperate sides of the linkage they are horribly misaligned.  I belived at the time of writing this that the solution to this was 3D printing the top and bottom jaw, but i instead laser cut them and superglued a piece of acrilic perpendicular to the base jaws.  all the nuts have been replaced with lock-nuts, and washers have been put between each linkage.  This has done wonders for the posablity of it.

   this week I got the top jaw working.  I solved my previous issue of the bottom linkages by attaching them at the very ends of either one, creating a sort of V that I can easily grab the bottom of.  the top jaw was initially designed with the intention of having a spring or rubber band on the inside pulling it shut, however it proved to be difficult to open with the string, and the spring would often open the mouth because it was to long.  having a loose connection and just allowing the top jaw to close using the force of gravity proved to work perfectly fine.  the linkage for the top jaw kept intersecting with the nuts on the supporting linkages, preventing it from closing all the way, so i opted to use a rat tail file and just sanded out a groove for the nuts to rest rather than redesign, recut, and reglue the whole piece again.
